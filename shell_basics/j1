NAME
     man - macros to format Reference Manual pages

SYNOPSIS
     nroff  -man  file ...

     troff  -man  file ...

DESCRIPTION
     These macros are used to lay out the reference pages in this
     manual.

     Any text argument _t may be zero to six words.  Quotes may be
     used  to  include blanks in a `word'.  If _t_e_x_t is empty, the
     special treatment is applied to the  next  input  line  with
     text to be printed.  In this way .I may be used to italicize
     a whole line, or .SM followed  by  .B  to  make  small  bold
     letters.

     A prevailing indent distance is remembered  between  succes-
     sive indented paragraphs, and is reset to default value upon
     reaching  a  non-indented  paragraph.   Default  units   for
     indents _i are ens.

     Type font and size are reset to default values  before  each
     paragraph,  and  after processing font and size setting mac-
     ros.

     These strings are predefined by -man:

     \*R  `(Reg)', trademark symbol in _t_r_o_f_f.

     \*S  Change to default type size.

CONVENTIONS
     A typical manual page for a command or function is laid  out
     as follows:

     .TH TITLE [1-8]
          The name of the  command  or  function  in  upper-case,
          which  serves  as the title of the manual page. This is
          followed by the number  of  the  section  in  which  it
          appears.

     .SH NAME name (or comma-separated list of names) -  one-line
          summary
          The name, or list of names, by  which  the  command  is
          called,  followed by a dash and then a one-line summary
          of the action performed.  All in roman font, this  sec-
          tion  contains  no _t_r_o_f_f(1) commands or escapes, and no
          macro requests.  It is used to generate  the  _w_h_a_t_i_s(1)

     .SH SYNOPSIS

          Commands:

               The syntax of the command  and  its  arguments  as
               typed  on  the  command line.  When in boldface, a
               word must be typed exactly as  printed.   When  in
               italics, a word can be replaced with text that you
               supply.  Syntactic symbols appear in roman face:

               [ ]  An argument, when surrounded by  brackets  is
                    optional.

               |    Arguments separated by  a  vertical  bar  are
                    exclusive.   You  can  supply  only item from
                    such a list.

               ...  Arguments  followed  by  an  elipsis  can  be
                    repeated.   When  an elipsis follows a brack-
                    eted set, the expression within the  brackets
                    can be repeated.

          Functions:

               If required, the  data  declaration,  or  #include
               directive,  is shown first, followed by the  func-
               tion declaration. Otherwise, the function declara-
               tion is shown.

          detail,  including how it interacts with files or data,
          and how it handles the standard input, standard  output
          and standard error.

          Filenames, and  references  to  commands  or  functions
          described  elswhere in the manual, are italicised.  The
          names of options, variables and other literal terms are
          in boldface.

          each affects the commands operation.
